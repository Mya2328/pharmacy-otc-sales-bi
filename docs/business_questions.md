# Business Questions – Pharmacy OTC Sales BI Project

## Context

A healthcare company sells over-the-counter (OTC) pharmacy products across multiple countries.
Management wants better visibility into sales performance to support decisions about
marketing, pricing, and regional focus.

## Main Business Questions

1. **Sales over time**
   - How are total sales trending by month?
   - Are there seasonal patterns or particular peak months?

2. **Product and category performance**
   - Which products generate the highest total revenue?
   - Which categories (e.g., pain relief, vitamins, etc.) are the most important for the business?
   - Which products/categories have the highest average revenue per unit?

3. **Geographical performance**
   - Which countries generate the most sales?
   - How does performance compare by region (e.g., Europe vs. Asia vs. Americas)?
   - Are there countries or regions with high potential but currently low sales?

4. **Customer / market behaviour (at region/country level)**
   - Do some regions buy more of certain categories than others?
   - Are there noticeable differences in quantity sold or unit prices between regions?

5. **Targets (optional extension)**
   - If we define simple sales targets by region or category, how does actual performance compare to target?
   - Which regions or categories are underperforming vs. target?

## Key KPIs

- Total Revenue
- Total Quantity Sold
- Average Selling Price (Revenue / Quantity)
- Revenue by Product / Category / Country / Region
